This application enables the creation of transcribed data from the British Museum's Worthington George Smith catalogue.

We would like people to transcribe the lines of text from the images into tabular format, for the Leverhulme funded
'Mapping the Palaeolithic' project team (Nick Ashton, Daniel Pett, Claire Harris (British Museum) and Simon Lewis (QMW))
to reuse in their work as a searchable archive and possibly for incorporation in the BM system.

Once transcribed, these data will be available as CSV or JSON and can be reused under a CC-BY licence.
