This application asks for assistance in pooling [radiocarbon dates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocarbon_dating) from
across the Mediterranean region. Archaeologists are increasingly keen
to gather large inventories of radiocarbon dates as an indirect way to
assess highs and lows in overall human activity (or population
numbers) in the past. This crowdsourcing project is an experimental
one to encourage sharing of these dates among those working in
Mediterranean archaeology. If you have access to publications that
list radiocarbon dates from the Mediterranean region or have dates you
have gathered yourself, then please consider contributing.
        
The interface for this project is deliberately very simple. Contributors are
given a link to our existing Mediterranean radiocarbon date listing so
that they can check whether or not their dates are already present. If
they are not, then the contributor needs to format their dates
according to the same pre-set column hadings provided, pasting them
(up to 100 in one go) into the online spreadsheet and submit them. Suggestions for correcting errors in existing dates in
the archive can also be made.
